Coding Style
------------
Always indent with tabs.
Please Keep lines less than 79 columns long as much as possible.

main() should always return an integer.

Testing
---------------
Make sure everything works.
 --sync with missing dependencies
 --builddeps with missing dependencies
 --sync --upgrade
 --sync --local
 --search

 Make sure aurbuild handles PKGBUILD errors gracefully.
 Try building a PKGBUILD with syntax errors, etc.

Prior to Release
----------------
 - Merge working tree into master
 - Tag the commit
 - Merge master into stable

Send git-formatted patches to louipc.ist@gmail.com
with 'aurbuild' in the subject.

aurbuild - A utility to build and install packages from ArchLinux' AUR through
the use of makepkg and pacman. Please note root access is required but will be
temporarily dropped to an under-privileged user during builds for safety and
package integrity. Read the man page aurbuild(1) for more details on this tool.

BE CAREFUL when adjusting build files as they could potentially harm your
system if not done properly!


Requirements:
	python, pacman 3.1.0 or later, makepkg (found in pacman) and fakeroot

Installation:
	cd misc/
	makepkg
	# Get root privs
	pacman -U aurbuild-VERSION.tar.gz

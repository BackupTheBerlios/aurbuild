To Do List:
 * Add a switch to change AUR url.
	example: aurbuild --url http://aur.test-site.org

 * Improve search
	- Support for multiple keywords
	- Narrowing down results by location, category, maintainer
	- Narrowing results by votes

 * Add support for an aurbuild config file

 * Make builddeps/syncdeps more sophisticated
	I'd like to be able to select whether to sync or build the deps
	individually. The logic for selecting to build then reviewing pkgbuild
	can be applied to building deps from [unsupported] as well.

 * Dynamically determine abs root from /etc/abs/abs.conf or shell variable
   $ABSROOT

 * Add support to build deps from [unsupported] more easily (Without having to
   run aurbuild multiple times)

 * Make builddeps properly register themselves as deps rather than explicitly
   installed. (Done with syncdeps)

 * Add a switch to view user comments.

 * Add a switch to take pacman arguments.

 * Use the libalpm hooks in pacman3 for python. Only because it would be faster
   and easier to maintain than my manual flat file parsing module (pacman.py).

 * Work out how source files should be cached
	I'm thinking just the tarball with scripts/local sources should be
	cached (instead of individual files), along with downloaded sources.
	It might be a good idea to propose a patch to makepkg as well.
	
	Correspond with dev of yaourt and makepkg to get some kind
	of standard location for caching sources

 * Look at raw_pkg_query to possibly improve search performance

 * Find what's causing a delay when building official packages 
	* aurbuild.find.find_dir() is causing a delay because of some ugly
	recursion
	* Alright I replaced the recursion with a `find` subprocess. It's
	a bit better but there is still more delay than I'd like.
	* Using pacman -Si to find the repo THEN doing the search in
	/var/abs/repo is about five times faster than just searching
	/var/abs (Just from shell experimentation)

 * Make sure root user is used for as few operations as possible
   Currently some directories in /var/tmp/aurbuild are owned by root

 * Make sure user_makedirs and user_copytree switch user effectively
   (Get rid of global variables)

 * Move cleanup() to utils. Should be able to take a variable number of
   arguments. cleanup() is used in a lot of functions in the main
   script and in utils. It probably is being called more than it is needed.
   It also uses global variables which should be gotten rid of if possible.
   Maybe it can be put into a class.

 * filter_deps() and main() in scripts/aurbuild need serious rework

 * Utilise AUR's JSON interface for search info (simplejson)

 * Change menu appearance
 * Change output when resolving dependencies

In Progress:
 * Move functions out of main script and into appropriate modules

To Do List:
 * Fix dependencies pulled in from aurbuild to be recognized as dependencies
   for the target package not as explicity installed.
   pacman -S --noconfirm -> pacman -D ?

 * Add a switch to view user comments.

 * Add a switch to take pacman arguments.

 * Optional: parse for makepkg v3 and v2 and write to /tmp/aurbuild somewhere.
   For v2 -w can be used, v3 an environment variable of PKGDEST= must be passed
   instead. I stayed away from this because of my limited time and potentialy
   unrealible (and ugly) parsing that would be involved. If it can be done
   reliably, it should be. Currently it relies on PKGDEST in makepkg.conf to be
   write and execute to aurbuild user or group.

 * Use the libalpm hooks in pacman3 for python. Only because it would be faster
   and easier to maintain than my manual flat file parsing module (pacman.py).

 * Look at raw_pkg_query to possibly improve search performance

 * Find what's causing a delay when building official packages 

 * Make sure root user is used for as few operations as possible
   Currently some directories in /var/tmp/aurbuild are owned by root

In Progress:
 * Move functions out of main script and into appropriate modules

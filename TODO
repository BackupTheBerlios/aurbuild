To Do List:
 * Fix dependencies pulled in from aurbuild to be recognized as dependencies
   for the target package not as explicity installed.
   pacman -S --noconfirm -> pacman -D ?

 * Add a switch to view user comments.

 * Add a switch to take pacman arguments.

 * Use the libalpm hooks in pacman3 for python. Only because it would be faster
   and easier to maintain than my manual flat file parsing module (pacman.py).

 * Look at raw_pkg_query to possibly improve search performance

 * Find what's causing a delay when building official packages 

 * Make sure root user is used for as few operations as possible
   Currently some directories in /var/tmp/aurbuild are owned by root

 * Make sure user_makedirs and user_copytree switch user effectively
   (Get rid of global variables)

 * Move cleanup() to utils. Should be able to take a variable number of
   arguments. cleanup() is used in a lot of functions in the main
   script and in utils. It probably is being called more than it is needed.
   It also uses global variables which should be gotten rid of if possible.
   Maybe it can be put into a class.

In Progress:
 * Move functions out of main script and into appropriate modules

To Do List:
 * Fix dependencies pulled in from aurbuild to be recognized as dependencies
   for the target package not as explicity installed.
   pacman -S --noconfirm -> pacman -D ?

 * Add a switch to view user comments.

 * Add a switch to take pacman arguments.

 * Use the libalpm hooks in pacman3 for python. Only because it would be faster
   and easier to maintain than my manual flat file parsing module (pacman.py).

 * Look at raw_pkg_query to possibly improve search performance

 * Find what's causing a delay when building official packages 

 * Make sure root user is used for as few operations as possible
   Currently some directories in /var/tmp/aurbuild are owned by root

In Progress:
 * Move functions out of main script and into appropriate modules

BUGS
----

 * Not all files in aurbuild HOME are owned by aurbuild

 * --builddeps --official considers any PKGBUILD under /var/abs/ to be
   official.

 * If running `sudo aurbuild` as a regular user the EDITOR variable isn't
   recognised. Run `sudo env EDITOR=$EDITOR aurbuild` for it to work.

 * File ownership and permission isn't being changed with ABS build copies.
